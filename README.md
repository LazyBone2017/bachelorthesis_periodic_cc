This is a protoype for the congestion control algorithm PULSE (Periodic Upper Limit Signal Estimate) in QUIC.
It is based on periodic manipulation of the congestion window.
All relevant files are found under /thesis.
Furthermore, there is a file: src/aioquic/quic/congestion/pulse.py which represents the actual congestion controller.
